			<h3>Chemical Engineering</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Biomolecular Engineering <br>
					<p class="myclass">
						focuses on manufacturing of biomolecules.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Materials Engineering <br>
					<p class="myclass">
						Involves properties of matter (material) and its applications to engineering.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Molecular Engineering <br>
					<p class="myclass">
						Focuses on the manufacturing of molecules.	
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Process Engineering <br>
					<p class="myclass">
						Focuses on the design, operation, control and optimization of chemical processes. These include natural and man-made materials, interaction of materials with machines, safety and health, energy conservation and waste and pollution control. This extends to plant design and layout, machine and wet process design and improvement and designing and creating products.		
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>

				<li>
					Utility Engineering <br>
					<p class="myclass">
						A branch of Civil Engineering that focuses on the planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and asset management of any and all utility systems, as well as the interaction between utility infrastructure and other civil infrastructure.	
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Water Resources Engineering <br>
					<p class="myclass">
						Prediction, planning, development, and management of water resources.		
					</p>

			<h3>Electrical Engineering</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Electronics Engineering <br>
					<p class="myclass">
						The creation of physical devices and abstract methods that make it possible to conduct electricity, magnetism and light, through low power electrical circuits deemed electronic circuits as well as through communication channels, in such a manner so as to make it possible to control, that is to actuate, on other external entities that can be mechanical, electrical, chemical and even biological in nature, even to the point of automation and thus achieving a manipulation over those natural phenomena so as to concede to them a specific form so that they abstractly represent something, in a processing action that is called program and therefore they become abstract signals of information, which can be subject of further processing and even end-user presentation in what is known as computing.
