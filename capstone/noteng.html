				<h3>Leonardo Da Vinci</h3>

				<p class="myclass2">
				Not content with being a great artist Da Vinci turned his hand at architecture, science, music, maths, engineering, and much more. His discoveries and inventions at the time were unfathomable to his contemporaries. Many of his inventions were never actually realized, but have been preserved for all time in his surviving journals. However, one of these, a hang glider, was actually practically developed in his time. 
				Some still seem a little "magical" today. His inventions included flying machines, armored vehicles, concentrated solar power, the adding machine, and a double hull. Most were alien concepts at the time but are common practice today. Although he is not as accomplished as many other engineers on the list, his ingenuity and creativity rank him as one of the most popular technical and artistic minds.</p>

				<h3>Elon Musk</h3>

				<p class="myclass2">
				South African born, Canadian engineer, businessman, and inventor Elon Musk is the founder of SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and SolarCity. His achievements are impressive and qualify him on our list of greatest engineers. The potential of his ambitious projects, once achieved, will be of great importance for the future of our species. While some would consider him more of a businessman than an engineer, per se, his drive to innovate and develop new technologies have earned him his place in history.</p>

				<h3>Nikola Tesla</h3>
				<img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/V0Oyr02GQd/ntesla.JPG" alt="Nikola Tesla"> <br>
				<p class="myclass2">
				Mr. Tesla's achievements are without doubt great. This Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and physicist had to be included on our list. Tesla's prolific technical mind helped him further many technologies in his day ... much to our benefit. He spent some of his life working for Thomas Edison who is widely lambasted for stealing many of his subordinate's inventions and claiming credit for himself. Whether true or not, Tesla soon fell out with Edison and left his company to pursue his own interests. His contributions to the design of modern AC electrical supply has made an enormous impact on all humanity. Tesla also made significant contributions to modern radio, X-ray, and the induction motor. Personally, Tesla was very quirky, to say the least. This often meant that many of his coworkers and peers considered him to be a little crazy and obsessive. Despite all this, Tesla's achievements have done more for modern society than many other engineers every.</p>

				<h3>James Clerk Maxwell</h3>
				<img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/V0Oyr02GQd/greatest-engineers-maxwell.jpg" alt="James Clerk Maxwell"> <br>
				<p class="myclass2">
				Another of the world's greatest engineers is James Clerk Maxwell. Scottish by birth, Maxwell would become a leading figure in mathematical physics. One of his most notable contributions to the world, and history, was his formulation of the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation. Was the first time electricity, magnetism, and the light was brought together in a unified explanation. His work has been described as the "second great unification in physics" after the groundbreaking work of Isaac Newton centuries prior. He is also widely considered to be the founder of modern electrical engineering.</p>
