			<li>
				<h3>Millau Viaduct</h3>, Millau, France <br>
				<img src="https://www.iveyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/viaduct1.jpg" alt="Millau Viaduct"> <br>
				<p class="myclass2">
					This incredible bridge, which is not open to pedestrians, is the tallest bridge in the world at 1,125 feet. You will certainly want to drive over it, but you'll get a better view from the roads and villages nearby, and best of all from the footpath that descends from the visitor center on the northern side of the bridge.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Hoover Dam</h3>, Nevada, USA <br>
				<img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53164a9004d99893aa3c2b0df5fe79ad3ba8d95/0_274_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=7475cc505195a0f0a5dc11b0f9b81405" alt="Hoover Dam"> <br>
				<p class="myclass2">
					The Hoover Dam is almost too well-known for its own good, but that doesn't diminish what an extraordinary engineering feat it is. Tours take visitors 530 feet down through the canyon wall to a viewing point where 90,000 gallons of water whoosh past every second, providing electricity for three states.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Palm Islands</h3>, Dubai, United Arab Emirates <br>
				<img src="https://www.iveyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/palm_islands.jpg" alt="Palm Islands"> <br>
				<p class="myclass2">
				Talk about a planned community! It's hard to say if these unique islands appear more utopian or dystopian, but there's no denying the ingenuity involved. They're best seen from the air, either by hiring a seaplane or helicopter, or from the restaurant on the 52nd floor of the nearby Harbour Residence and Spa Hotel.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><h3>Burj Khalifa</h3>, Dubai, United Arab Emirates <br>
				<img src="https://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/Images/BurjKhalifa-02982_new_tcm290-85702.jpg" alt="Burj Khalifa"> <br>
				<p class="myclass2">
				Another viewing point for the Palm Islands is the observation deck of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Why go see it? The building is more than a half-mile high and has more than 160 stories; visiting the observation deck is an almost dizzying experience.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><h3>The Channel Tunnel</h3>, English Channel <br>
				<img src="https://d1ix0byejyn2u7.cloudfront.net/drive/images/uploads/headers/ws_cropper/1_0x0_790x520_0x520_channel_tunnel.jpg" alt="The Channel Tunnel"> <br>
				<p class="myclass2">
				This is among the easiest modern engineering marvels to bag during your travels â€” you can take a car, bus or train right through. It mostly looks like, well, a tunnel, but it's still worth skipping the plane to experience. Completed almost 200 years after it was first proposed by Albert Mathieu in 1802, the 31-mile tunnel goes 250 feet under the sea bed to connect England to France (or France to England, depending on your perspective). The tunnel is equipped with cell antennae to boot, so you don't even have to go off the grid.

				<h3>Large Hadron Collider</h3>, Geneva, France-Switzerland <br>
				<img src="https://www.iveyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/collider.jpg" alt="Large Hadron Collider"> <br>
				<p class="myclass2">
				The Large Hadron Collider is the rare scientific research structure that is almost a household name, such is its stature among engineering feats. The 17-mile-long collider is used to accelerate sub-atomic particles such as the Higgs boson, or so-called "God particle," to reveal information about how these particles behave. The collider is located more than 500 feet under the ground straddling the France-Switzerland border. <br>

				In 2013, CERN (the European Council for Nuclear Research) opened the accelerator to tours for the first time. Tours of the actual accelerator occur only when it isn't in use, the next instance of which will be winter of 2018, according to a CERN spokesperson. However, there's a visitor center where you can learn more about the accelerator and CERN's work.
